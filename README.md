# QuantumManyBody
 A Mathematica package to perform numerical computations on quantum many body physics problems.

 In recent days, an increasing number of physicists with a high-energy background (or, more specifically, with a background in string theory) are getting interested in condensed matter problems and quantum computing. In the string theory community, Wolfram Mathematica is the standard programming language that people use. This package hopes to be a useful tool to string theorists who are moving to condensed matter and quantum computing problems, by providing functionalities to perform numerical computations using their favorite language. In the near future, I hope to add more support to parallel computations, in order to make this package useful also for people who want to use Mathematica to perform high performance computations.
 Moreover, I hope to add more functionalities performing quantum algorithms.

 An auxiliary Mathematica notebook, containing some examples of usage, is also included. This notebook can be seen as a tutorial which explains the main functionalities provided by the package.

 Of course, the package is still in its first version. For any bugs or suggestions, you may contact me at [dario.rosa85@gmail.com](dario.rosa85@gmail.com).
